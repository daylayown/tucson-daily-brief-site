"""generate_brief.py — deterministic Tucson Daily Brief generator.

Replaces the OpenClaw 6 AM briefing agent. The agent was an agent runtime whose
agency we had already designed away (sources.json is the sole source of truth,
TUCSON-BRIEF.md pins the format and save path), and the agent loop introduced
three recurring failure modes, all from using an agent for deterministic work:

  1. mid-run context compaction silently dropped heavy feeds before synthesis,
     so the brief collapsed onto whichever 2 sources happened to survive;
  2. the agent occasionally saved the brief to the wrong path, stalling the
     whole 6:10 podcast/blog pipeline;
  3. holding every raw feed in one long context bloated the run.

Here the model does exactly ONE thing — read the day's already-fetched items and
write the brief (rank / select / dedupe / prose). Everything else is Python:

  * fetch every source in sources.json (RSS / Bluesky / NWS) — nothing can be
    silently dropped, because Python guarantees every feed reaches the prompt;
  * filter to a recent time window, dedupe;
  * read EDITOR-TIPS.md and include in-window tips;
  * one bounded Sonnet call for synthesis (no agent loop -> no compaction);
  * write to the canonical path with open(path, "w") — the mis-save bug is
    structurally impossible;
  * append a DETERMINISTIC provenance footer (Python knows exactly which feeds
    returned data and which failed — more honest than the model claiming).

Usage:
    python generate_brief.py                  # full run, write canonical brief
    python generate_brief.py --dry-run        # fetch + filter, print item digest, NO API call
    python generate_brief.py --print          # full run, print to stdout instead of writing
    python generate_brief.py --date 2026-06-25
    python generate_brief.py --hours 48       # widen the recency window (default 36h)
    python generate_brief.py --out /tmp/x.md  # write somewhere else (side-by-side testing)

SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """\
You are the editor of the Tucson Daily Brief, a daily hyper-local news briefing \
for the Tucson / Pima County area. Today is {today_human} (America/Phoenix).

You are given the day's news items, ALREADY FETCHED from the brief's vetted \
sources (you do not fetch anything — work only from what is below). Your job is \
editorial judgment: select, rank, deduplicate, and write the brief.

EDITORIAL PRIORITIES (rank stories in this order; lead with the highest available):
1. Government actions — city council votes, county decisions, AZ legislation affecting Tucson, ballot measures
2. Public safety — major incidents, emergency alerts, law enforcement news (not routine blotter)
3. Schools — the K-12 districts: TUSD, Amphitheater, Marana, Sunnyside, Vail,
   Sahuarita, Catalina Foothills, Flowing Wells, Tanque Verde. (U of A is NOT a
   school district — university news belongs in its topical section.)
4. Development & business — construction, business openings/closings, economic news
5. Community & events — major events, cultural happenings (only if genuinely significant)
6. What your officials are saying — press releases from the officials who represent
   Tucson and, in competitive races, the candidates. Never leads the brief.
7. Weather — always include; lead with it ONLY if an active alert exists

SELECTION RULES:
- Target 7-12 stories. Quality over quantity. Omit empty sections rather than padding.
- DEDUPLICATE: if the same story appears in multiple sources, merge and cite all of them.
- SOURCE DIVERSITY: draw across the available sources; do not lean on one or two \
outlets if others carry relevant local stories. (Some sources may simply have nothing \
local today — that is fine; never invent stories to balance them.)
- Exclude national/state news UNLESS it directly impacts Tucson/Pima County.
- Exclude sports unless it's a major U of A item and significant (not routine results).
- Exclude sponsored/affiliate/advertorial content.
- Items flagged [UNDATED] may be stale — only use one if clearly still relevant, and hedge.
- Soft-hedge single-source or unconfirmed items ("according to [outlet]," "is scheduled to").
- NEVER fabricate facts, names, dates, quotes, or sources. If unsure, leave it out.
- Write neutral, factual AP-style prose. No opinion, no framing — even on political items.

EDITOR TIPS: The blocks under "=== EDITOR TIPS ===" are hand-submitted leads. Treat \
each as a candidate story ranked normally. Follow each tip's own editor note (attribution, \
hedging, what to withhold). Do not invent details beyond the tip and its links.

OFFICIALS: Write the 📢 section from "=== OFFICIALS ===" if that block is present; \
omit the whole section if it is absent or empty. Rules, all of them load-bearing:
- Everything there is a CLAIM, not a fact. Write "said in a release" / "announced" — \
never restate a press release as established fact, and never adopt its framing.
- Keep the two groups distinct. Officials speak as officeholders; candidates speak as \
campaigns. Say which. An incumbent may legitimately appear in both.
- Contested races travel in pairs. If the block carries a NOTE that one side posted \
nothing, SAY SO in the brief — "X's campaign did not post this week." Reporting one \
side silently, with no mention of the other, is the failure this rule exists to stop.
- 1-2 sentences per item, 4-6 items total. Prefer items with Tucson-area consequence \
over national message discipline.
- Draw this section ONLY from the "=== OFFICIALS ===" block. Do not promote a story \
or a social post out of the news items into it — those belong in their own sections, \
and an item pulled across arrives without the URL this section requires.
- Every item needs its markdown link, same as everywhere else. If an item has no URL, \
leave it out.

SCHOOLS: The 🎓 section covers the K-12 districts. It draws from TWO kinds of \
material and the difference decides how you write each item:
- The "=== SCHOOLS ===" block is what districts said on their OWN channels. \
Every line there is an announcement, not a finding: write "the district \
announced" / "said in a post" — never restate it as established fact, and never \
adopt its framing.
- A school story reported by a NEWS OUTLET in the news items belongs in this \
section too, written normally and cited to the outlet. Put it here, not under \
Government or Community — one school story, one place, never both.
- SELECT HARD. Most district posts are routine parent logistics and do NOT \
belong in a news brief: hiring posts, open-enrollment reminders, supply lists, \
lunch menus, app downloads, spirit weeks, photo-use policies, meet-the-teacher \
nights, individual student or staff recognition. Include an item only if it has \
district-wide or metro consequence — budgets, bonds and overrides, board \
decisions, school closures or boundary changes, superintendent changes, policy \
or state-law changes that affect families, safety incidents, ballot measures, \
construction, labor actions.
- If several districts announced the SAME thing, merge them into one item and \
name the districts. That convergence is the story.
- FERPA: never name, photograph-describe, or identify an individual student, \
whatever the district published.
- 1-3 items, 1-2 sentences each. If nothing clears the bar, OMIT THE WHOLE \
SECTION. A padded schools section is worse than no schools section.
- If the block carries a "NOT CHECKED TODAY" note: never write that those \
districts announced nothing, and never write a sentence that claims the section \
covers all of them. That is a constraint on what you claim, NOT an instruction \
to add a disclaimer — do not append "other districts were not checked" or any \
standing caveat to the section. Naming the districts an item actually came from \
is already accurate.
- Every item needs its markdown link, same as everywhere else.

WEATHER: Write the ⛈️ section from the NWS data under "=== WEATHER ===". If an active \
alert exists, lead that section with a ⚠️ callout in bold. Include today's \
conditions/high/low/wind, tonight, tomorrow, and a 2-3 sentence outlook.

OUTPUT FORMAT — output ONLY the briefing, starting with the title line. No preamble, \
no "Good morning," no sign-off, no footer (the system appends provenance). Use this \
structure, with ─── dividers between sections, omitting any section with no stories:

Tucson Daily Brief — {today_human}

In the skeleton below, square brackets appear ONLY as markdown link syntax. The \
headline is bold text with no brackets around it — write `**Headline.**`, never \
`**[Headline.]**`.

🚨 Public Safety
**Headline.** Two to three sentences of neutral summary.
📰 [Source Name](https://direct-article-url)

───

🏛️ Government
(same per-story format)

───

🎓 Schools
**Headline.** Two to three sentences. District announcements are attributed as \
announcements; outlet-reported items are cited to the outlet.
📰 [Source Name](https://direct-url)

───

🏗️ Development & Business
(same per-story format)

───

🎉 Community & Events
(same per-story format)

───

📢 What Your Officials Are Saying
**Name (role).** One or two sentences on what they said, attributed as a release.

⛈️ Weather — Tucson
[alert callout if any, then forecast as described]

📄 NWS Tucson Forecast API

ATTRIBUTION: every story ends with 📰 and a markdown link to the DIRECT article URL \
from its LINK field: `📰 [Source Name](url)`. Multi-source: `📰 [A](url1), [B](url2)`. \
If an item's LINK is "(none)", cite the source name without a link. Never link to a homepage.
