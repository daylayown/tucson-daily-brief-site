<h2>🏛️ Government</h2>
<p><strong>Tucson faces $27M deficit; mayor and council reject cuts to housing and drug ordinance.</strong> As city officials work to close a $27 million shortfall this fiscal year, Tucson's mayor and council reaffirmed their commitment to nonprofit organizations and the city's public drug use prevention initiatives at a Wednesday study session. Chief Financial Officer Anna Rosenberry presented four options generating only $9.1 million in savings — a fraction of the full gap — and recommended against cutting the general fund's share of housing investments. Council members pushed back on proposals to reduce nonprofit contracts and scale back the public drug ordinance.</p>

<p><strong>Pima County supervisors adopt policy restricting federal immigration enforcement on county property.</strong> The Board of Supervisors passed two new policies Tuesday limiting how federal immigration agents can operate on county-owned property, including a prohibition on masked law enforcement officers. Supporters called it a meaningful statement of local values; Republican Supervisor Christy called it &quot;toothless,&quot; noting legal limits on the county's ability to block federal agents.</p>

<p><strong>RTA Next election is one month away — no tax increase, but major stakes for roads and transit.</strong> Tucson-area voters will decide in March whether to approve the $2.67 billion Regional Transportation Authority Next plan, which determines which roads and transit routes get funded in coming years. The measure does not raise taxes but allocates how existing transportation revenue is spent. Marana and Oro Valley have specific projects — including long-delayed Silverbell Road and Tangerine Road improvements — riding on the outcome. Oro Valley's Dial-A-Ride service also depends on continued RTA funding.</p>

<p><strong>Gov. Hobbs vetoes Republican bills imposing harsher SNAP penalties.</strong> Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed a package of bills that would have put stricter penalties on Arizona's food assistance program in response to changes made by the federal &quot;One Big Beautiful Bill Act.&quot; Hobbs said the Arizona Department of Economic Security has already taken action to improve benefit accuracy, making additional punitive measures unnecessary and harmful to hundreds of thousands of Arizonans who depend on SNAP.</p>

<p><strong>UA dismantles cultural housing communities, shifts to interdisciplinary model.</strong> A University of Arizona program that placed students from shared cultural backgrounds together in dormitories will no longer center on cultural identity.

<h2>🏗️ Development &amp; Business</h2>
<p><strong>Marana rejects data center referendum petitions.</strong> The Town of Marana has determined that petitions submitted to put a proposed data center project to a public vote do not meet Arizona legal requirements for a referendum. The decision effectively clears the path for the data center to proceed without a direct public vote, despite grassroots opposition that collected signatures over recent weeks.</p>
