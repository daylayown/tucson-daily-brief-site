<h2>🎓 Education</h2>
<p><strong>ASDB Outlines Relocation Plan; Tucson Board Member Resigns in Protest.</strong> The Arizona State Schools for the Deaf and Blind detailed plans to close its dormitories, mainstream visually impaired students at local schools, and relocate the Tucson campus to Oro Valley next summer due to a $3 million deficit and declining enrollment. ASDB Governing Board member Bill Koehler, a former ASDB assistant superintendent and lone Tucson voice, resigned February 10 after the board voted 5-2 to shutter the campus and lay off approximately 60 Tucson staff members. Koehler filed an open meeting law report in protest. Families of visually-impaired students express stress over the vague implementation details and uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona Teachers Face Strike Ban and Union Restrictions Under GOP Bills.</strong> Republican-backed legislation would prohibit teachers from striking against their districts under threat of state funding cuts and restrict union activity at public schools, preventing use of school resources for union organizing or meetings. The Arizona Education Association, representing 22,000+ public school employees, lambasted the proposals as government overreach and political retaliation, noting they attack teachers while the state faces an ongoing exodus of over 1,000 teachers annually due to low pay and poor working conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 123 School Funding Renewal Stalls on Republican Conditions.</strong> Republicans want to overhaul Proposition 123—the $300 million annual public school funding source that expired last year—restricting money to teacher raises for full-time teachers meeting performance benchmarks while excluding support staff. Education advocates warn the new proposal with yearly legislative approval will worsen teacher retention by creating annual salary uncertainty.</p>
