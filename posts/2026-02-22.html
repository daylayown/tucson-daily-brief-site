<h2>🏛️ Government</h2>
<p><strong>Tucson leaders push back on cuts as city faces $27 million deficit.</strong> City officials are wrestling with a $27 million shortfall in the current fiscal year, but Mayor and Council reaffirmed their commitment to nonprofit organizations and the city's public drug-use prevention ordinance at Wednesday's study session. Assistant City Manager Anna Rosenberry presented four budget-cutting options totaling only $9.1 million in near-term savings — a fraction of what's needed — leaving the full gap unresolved heading into spring budget talks.</p>

<p><strong>Pima County adopts twin policies restricting federal immigration enforcement.</strong> The Board of Supervisors approved two measures limiting how federal immigration agents can operate on county property, including a ban on masked law enforcement conducting raids on county grounds. Supporters called it a principled stand; Republican Supervisor Christy dismissed it as &quot;toothless.&quot; The vote follows weeks of heightened tension over ICE activity in the region.</p>

<p><strong>RTA Next election is next month — and it won't raise your taxes.</strong> A March ballot measure will ask voters to approve a $2.67 billion regional transportation plan under the Regional Transportation Authority. The measure won't increase taxes, but it will determine which roads get fixed — or don't — over the next several years, and includes significant implications for bus transit riders. Silverbell Road and Tangerine Road improvements, long delayed, are both part of the plan.</p>

<p><strong>Marana rejects data center referendum petitions.</strong> The Town of Marana has determined that petitions filed to put a proposed data center project to a public vote do not meet requirements under Arizona law, effectively clearing the path for the development to move forward without a citizen vote.</p>

Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) toured the ICE Eloy Detention Center Wednesday and sharply criticized the detention of elderly and medically vulnerable individuals. &quot;It's just cruel and inhumane,&quot; she said.

<h2>🎓 Education</h2>
<p><strong>University of Arizona dismantles cultural living-learning communities.</strong> A UA program that placed students from similar cultural backgrounds together in residence halls will no longer center on cultural identity. The university is rebranding the effort with an interdisciplinary academic focus. The shift comes amid a national wave of DEI-related changes at public universities, though UA has not publicly framed it that way.</p>
