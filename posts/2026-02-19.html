<h2>🏛️ Government &amp; Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Pima County supervisors adopt policies restricting ICE on county property.</strong> The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to limit federal immigration enforcement access to county facilities and ban law enforcement from wearing masks during operations on county property. Supporters called the resolution a necessary signal to federal agents; GOP Supervisor Christy labeled it &quot;toothless&quot; and insufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona Senate advances mail-in ballot ID requirement.</strong> Under a bill dubbed the &quot;Safer Elections, Faster Results Act,&quot; Arizona voters may soon need to provide government-issued photo identification for their mail-in ballots to be counted. Supporters say the measure will accelerate election night results; critics call it a new barrier to voting access that would disproportionately affect Pima County voters.</p>

<p><strong>AG Mayes moves to slash Tucson Electric Power's proposed 14% rate hike to 4%.</strong> Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes filed expert testimony with the Arizona Corporation Commission urging regulators to dramatically cut TEP's requested rate increase. The filing sets up a high-stakes showdown between state government and the region's largest electric utility ahead of a formal ACC proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>Marana residents meet with town leadership over proposed ICE detention facility.</strong> Members of PRICE, a Marana community group opposing a federal immigration detention center proposed for the area, met this week with Mayor Jon Post and Town Manager Terry Rozema to share concerns and hear the town's position. Community opposition to the facility has been building for weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Sen. Mark Kelly mulling 2028 presidential run after fundraising surge.</strong> After President Trump publicly called for Kelly's arrest on sedition charges last November, the Arizona senator's fundraising exploded — he has now raised $33 million since his 2022 election, more than any other incumbent senator facing 2028 reelection. Kelly told the BBC this week he will &quot;seriously consider&quot; a presidential campaign, and Democratic strategists in Iowa and New Hampshire say he would be a credible contender.</p>

<h2>🚨 Public Safety</h2>
<p><strong>No DNA match in Nancy Guthrie case; investigation continues.</strong> DNA from gloves found roughly two miles from the Tucson-area home of Nancy Guthrie — the 84-year-old mother of TODAY show host Savannah Guthrie — did not match any profile in a national database and did not match DNA found at the property, the Pima County Sheriff's Department announced Tuesday. Investigators have not announced the next steps publicly.</p>

<p><strong>Rep. Grijalva advocates for release of detained 79-year-old asylum seeker.</strong> Following an Arizona Daily Star investigation, Rep. Adelita Grijalva visited a 79-year-old asylum seeker with dementia currently held in ICE custody. Grijalva described the visit as &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and is now publicly calling for the woman's immediate release, saying the case illustrates the human cost of federal immigration enforcement.</p>

<h2>🏫 Education</h2>
<p><strong>Legislature targets teachers who organized ICE callout days.</strong> Republican state lawmakers have introduced legislation that would revoke teacher employment benefits and restrict state funding to school districts in cases where teachers organized coordinated callouts in response to ICE enforcement activity. The bill is a direct legislative response to statewide teacher walkouts earlier this year.</p>

<p><strong>Historic neighborhoods may be shielded from state middle-housing mandates.</strong> A divided state panel has advanced a rule that would allow Arizona historic districts — including several in Tucson — to be exempted from state laws requiring higher-density housing development near transit corridors. The exemption could significantly limit where new multi-family housing can be built in older Tucson neighborhoods.</p>

<h2>🏗️ Development &amp; Business</h2>
<p><strong>Aluminum Dynamics receives final permit for Benson aluminum recycling plant.</strong> The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality has issued the final air quality permit allowing Aluminum Dynamics to build and operate a recycling facility in Benson, despite ongoing litigation from local opposition group Health Over Wealth Benson. Critics cite unresolved concerns about air pollutants and impacts to San Pedro River aquifers; ADEQ says the permit includes mandatory monitoring and enforcement provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Group drops challenge to controversial Marana data center.</strong> Arizonans for Responsible Development, which submitted roughly 2,800 signatures in a petition to reverse zoning for the Beale Infrastructure data center project, dropped its legal challenge on Tuesday. The project is now cleared to move forward after months of organized community opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Nuestras Raíces brings Latino and Indigenous voices to Tucson Festival of Books.</strong> The Pima County Public Library's Nuestras Raíces program is presenting 28 Latinx and Indigenous authors at the Festival of Books, March 14–15 at the University of Arizona. The lineup includes a bilingual panel with Luis Alberto Urrea and Álvaro Enrigue, as well as poetry, memoirs, and children's books. Organizers say the program carries particular weight this year amid national debates over cultural representation and immigration.</p>

<p><strong>Drink for Solidarity cocktail competition returns for Lunar New Year.</strong> Eight Tucson bartenders will compete to craft cocktails and mocktails inspired by the Chinese Chorizo Project at Zerai's Intl Bar, 2725 E. Broadway Blvd., on Monday, Feb. 24 (6–9 p.m.). Organizers suggest a $10 donation for tastings; the event benefits local culinary collaboration and celebrates the Year of the Fire Horse.</p>
