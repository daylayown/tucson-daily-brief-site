#   Opus 5  -> the real brief, via run_brief.sh + the full production
#             pipeline. Untouched by this script.

#   Terra   -> challenger, files only

# --no-telegram is deliberate: the point is to read real briefs side by
# side in brief-bake-off/, and three briefs every morning would get the alert
# channel muted. Luna was dropped 2026-07-30 (buried a live Extreme Heat
# Warning last on the morning it took effect).
#
# Cost ~$0.32/day (~$9.40/mo) — Flash adds under a cent. Named arms are
# explicit on purpose: leaving this bare would run every challenger and
# multiply that. NOTE the script exits before ANY arm runs if a named arm's
# key is missing, so don't add an arm here until its key is in
# ~/.config/environment.d/ (cron does not read ~/.bashrc).
